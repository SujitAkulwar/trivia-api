## Error Handling

In case of errors, the API will return appropriate HTTP status codes along with error messages in the response body. Common error codes include:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters or body.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the Trivia API enforces rate limiting. Each API key is subject to a certain number of requests per minute. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

## Examples

### Example Request

```http
GET /api/questions/random
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "category": "Science",
  "question": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?",
  "options": ["Au", "Ag", "Hg", "Cu"]
}
```
